					      <h4>Cycloidal Gearbox</h4>
					      <p>The original aim of this project was to create a 3D printed planetary gearbox for a 3D printed legged robot.
                  The size constraints on the gearbox led the teeth of the spur gears very small.
                  After some static testing on the 3D printed gears, it was determined to be too weak for the gearbox's purpose.
                  With more research done, it was concluded that a cycloidal gearbox would be stronger because of its larger and therefore stronger teeth.
                  Because it is not as commonly used as spur gears, I had to read several papers to understand how to design it.

					      <h4>Wireless Deadbolt Unlocker</h4>
					      <p>As a project for the Planar Machinery class, my group chose to go with an external, mechanical deadbolt unlocker.
                  It is much cheaper than on the market smart locks and does not require replacing the entire doorknob, making it useful for renters.
                  I took the lead on the mechanical design, choosing a 3:1 gear ratio to supply more torque from the servo motor and to provide the correct degrees of rotation due to the servo motor's 270 degree range.
                  I took care to choose cheaper parts and to ensure the stack up would be appropriate in the CAD before prototyping.
                  The box and gears were laser cut from acrylic to display what was happening on the inside with bearing press fit into them to ensure the shaft would turn smoothly.
                  As a part of the project, the CAD model was animated and a motion analysis was performed on it using Solidworks.

                  Our group had Baxter solve a puzzle based on the computer game, tetris, and place the tetris pieces into a frame.
                  The robot would use the AR tags placed on the pieces to determine its location and orientation and then place them in its final location an orientation.
                  My part involved laser cutting the tetris pieces with AR tags as well as helping with determining the AR tracking orientations.

                  I did nearly all of the designing of the mechanical system, from creating the CAD to sourcing the cheapest parts that would still enable high school students a robust structure with design versatility.
                  The object of this kit was to be used in workshops taken to schools where the students will learn about gear ratios and elementary circuits.
                  This year we were able to host 4 workshops using these kits and the students enjoyed racing their new cars that they got to keep.

					      <h4>Gear Molding</h4>
					      <p>As part of a never ending goal to cut costs, the mechanical team, under the direction of an older advisor, learned to resin cast gears.
                  This new inhouse manufacturing method cut costs from $5 per gear to less than a dollar per gear.
                  I helped with designing the 3D printed postive of the gears in Solidworks and then helped make the mold using silicone as well as cast the gears using polyurethane.
                  Fortunately, our prototyping turned out well and were able to mass produce the gears rather inexpensively.
                  The gear molding process was extensively detailed in a grant application for funding.

					      <h4>Robotics Kit Parts Design</h4>
					      <p>As part of the mechanical team, we design the parts that the students build their robots with.
                  The parts have to be versatile so students can use them for many different structures or mechanisms.
                  We made many adjustments to the kit metal parts from previous years including decreasing the hole spacing, changing the bearing blocks from square tubing to C-Channel for easier access, and modifying the base kit design.
                  There was a fair amount of prototyping in making these adjustments.
                  The adjustments to the custom made parts required new engineering drawings so I created the new drawings as well as reached out to many local manufacturers to compare prices and find the cheapest one.
